DISSOLVE SHADERS PACKAGE
- every shader have customizable parameters, which can be changed either in the Inspector
  or via script
  
- random dissolve pattern via included script(DissolveRandomPattern)

- you can modify the parameters via script by creating a new C# script and using the 
  following line of code:

  renderer.material.SetFloat([Parameter], [Amount]);
 
  for example:  float sliceAmount -= Time.deltaTime * dissolveSpeed;
			    collidedObject.renderer.material.SetFloat("_DissolvePower", 0.65f + Mathf.Sin(0.9f)*sliceAmount);  

  after you create the script, you have to add it to the object with the dissolve material, and thats all.

- DissolveOnClick(used to dissolve objects when clicking on them):
  - add the script to the object you want to dissolve by clicking on it 
  - add the material you want to use to dissolve it to the "Dissolve Material" property in the Inspector(ex. Dissolve Diffuse)
  - add the texture you want to use as a dissolve pattern to the "Dissolve Pattern" property in the Inspector(ex. uniformDissolve)
  - add a speed you want to use to dissolve the object to the "Dissolve Speed" property in the Inspector(ex. 0.5)
  - play the game and click on the object

- DissolveOnCollision(used to dissolve objects on collision with projectiles or other such objects):
  - add the script to the projectile object
  - add the material you want to use to dissolve it to the "Dissolve Material" property in the Inspector(ex. Dissolve Diffuse)
  - add the texture you want to use as a dissolve pattern to the "Dissolve Pattern" property in the Inspector(ex. uniformDissolve)
  - add a speed you want to use to dissolve the object to the "Dissolve Speed" property in the Inspector(ex. 0.5)
  - if you want to dissolve just some objects and not everything the projectile touches, just create a new tag
    (ex. Dissolvable), assign it to the objects, then check the CheckForTag property in the inspector and change
    the ObjectTag property to be just the same as the tag (ex. Dissolvable)
  - play the game and shoot the projectile towards the object you want to dissolve 

- DissolveRandomPattern(used to randomize a bit the pattern of the dissolve shader)
